## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpeg">

Hi! I am a Phd student from [School of Electrical and Computing Engeneering (FEEC)](https://www.fee.unicamp.br) at State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil.
I got my degree in Electrical Engineering from SÃ£o Paulo State University (UNESP) in 2021 and my master's degree in 2024 from UNICAMP.
Currently, I live with my wife and love to read, cook and knit on my free time.

## Research Interest

My current research focus on biologically inspired cognitive architectures, specially on the processes involving episodic memory.
I am also exploring means of object discovery for hierachical object segmentation through self-supervised learning.
As a research in the field of Artificial Intelligence, I dream of unveiling the misteries of how human minds function and how we can develop better agents to help (and not exploit) human kind.

## Main Projects

### Master's Dissertation

### Cognitive Systems Toolkit

The [CST Toolkit](https://cst.fee.unicamp.br/) is a Java-based toolkit to allow the construction of Cognitive Architectures. It is being developed at the University of Campinas by a group of researchers in the field of Cognitive Architectures leaded by Prof. Ricardo Gudwin.

As part of the CST group, I was involved in the projects:

- CST CLI: A command line interface (CLI) to easily create CST projects. [GitHub](https://github.com/CST-Group/CST-CLI)
- WS3D Coppelia: A interface for controling simulated agents in the CoppeliaSim simulator. [GitHub](https://github.com/CST-Group/WS3D-Coppelia)
